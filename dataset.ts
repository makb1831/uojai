Office of the Controller of Examinations
INTRODUCTION
Preparation and approval of examination policies and rules is the one of the key tasks that
each new university has to perform. University of Jhang started enrollment of students in 2019.
Initially, the University decided to follow the academic and examination setup of GC University
Faisalabad as a model for its 1st session. However, the office of Controller of Examination
promptly started working on formation of its own examination rules and regulations in compliance
with HEC.
In very next year i.e., 2020, University of Jhang hold its 1st Academic Council in which
university examination rules and regulations for undergraduate and postgraduate programs were
presented and approved which are applicable from session (2021 onward). In the 2nd meeting of
Academic Council 2022, these rules have been amended to adopt the changing requirement of the
departments.
Further, it is necessary to inform students & faculty about the important dates throughout the
semester and year. Office of the Controller of Examination prepares University Academic Calendar
each year under the guidelines of HEC and also ensures that all academic activities of the
University are being carried according to it. Execution of Academic Calendar during Covid-19
was a biggest challenge which was successfully dealt with through blended mode of classes and
examination.
Another major task of the office of the Controller of Examination was to propose and approve
design of Academic Transcripts and Degrees from the floor of Academic Council which is near to
completion. 1st Convocation of the University is planned in 2023 in which degrees will be
conferred to about 500 passed out undergraduate and postgraduate students of university. Office
of the Controller of Examination formulated structure of examination branch and allocated
functions and staff to each component.

INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Department of achievers. Chemistry is very important branch of science
and plays a vital role in the field of chemical and biological sciences. Chemical technologies enrich
our quality of life in numerous ways by providing new solutions to problems in health, materials,
and energy usage. It is necessary to train our young generation to understand the principles
underlying the composition, structure, and properties of matter, and utilize these for benefit of
mankind. Here at UOJ the theoretical background of students is further expanded through carefully
designed courses of laboratory experiments to demonstrate basic concepts and experimental
techniques that serve as a stepping stone towards enhancement of problem-solving skills needed
for the success in their careers and personal growth.
Faculty members in the chemistry department are taking initiatives to build up
infrastructural facilities for conducting research and trying to develop national and international
linkages for collaborative research that would be very helpful for the successful implementation
of exciting research projects. The basic objective of our department is to educate the next
generation of chemists with the capacity to resolve real problems and provide leadership that can
lead to the economic transformation of society.

Department of Mathematics
INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Department of Mathematics, University of Jhang! Mathematics at
University of Jhang is currently thriving, both in terms of teaching and research. The
department of mathematics had its inception in 2019 with the introduction of regular
undergraduate program, BS Mathematics. The greatest strength of the mathematics
department is a team of enthusiastic students and dedicated faculty members. The faculty co ordinate the co-curricular, extra-curricular and extension activities of the department and cater
students’ interest in mathematics beyond the syllabus. We are deeply committed to superior
research in mathematics and students are trained in analytic thinking and reasoning. Currently,
we have two undergraduate specialties, namely, pure mathematics and applied mathematics.
Department recruits undergraduate students by the general category of mathematics and does
not stipulate their specialty in the first three years but strengthens the basic training for them.
In the fourth year, it divides them into different specialties according to mental characteristics
of different students. Mathematical majors can develop programs in many different ways and
pursue career paths in actuarial science, cryptography, information technology and
mathematical education. In department large segments of current mathematical research are
represented by the active research programs and interests of our faculty. The Department has
strengths and pursues original investigations in Boundary layer flows and structure
interactions, Mathematical modeling of Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow problems,
Numerical solutions of non-linear fractional partial differential equations, Finite element and
finite difference methods, Riemannian Geometry, Partial Differential Equations, Functional
Analysis Fixed point theory, Fuzzy logics, Inequalities, Mathematical physics, Algebraic
topology, Algebraic geometry and algebra, Graph theory, Machine learning, Number theory,
Combinatorics and algorithms, Category theory, Logic and its applications to computer
science, and several other areas of current mathematical development. A clearer idea of the
exact areas engaging the Department's current interest can be formed from the list of the
faculty and their individual areas of research.
DEPARTMENT VISION
Mathematics plays a vital rule in the development of students to develop scientific,
industrial and economic approach towards leadership, through learner-centered teaching and
research, while strengthening their identity at Regional, National and International level. The
department desires to be one of the top research institutions in the country. Further, the
department aims to be among the best higher education providers in the region.
DEPARTMENT MISSION
Mathematics is of ever-increasing importance in science, technology and the
department play a principal role in the education and research at University of Jhang. In this
era of emerging educational trends, mathematics has come to be recognized as the language
of science and the key to understand the mechanics of our world. Mathematics is oldest
academic subject and is one of the most mature and well-developed disciplines of basic
sciences. Rigorous concepts in engineering, management sciences, social sciences, medicine
and physics can be easily countered with the help of mathematical techniques. Main objectives
are
• To engage in goal-oriented high-level teaching and research.
• To promote cooperation and inter-disciplinary relationships with other teaching and
research organizations of the country and abroad.
• To arrange conferences, seminars and refresher courses for the promotion of
mathematics education and research.

psychologists by providing them training and education of high-quality standards. Since the
department is established, it is getting stronger with the introduction of new program and

Psychology is a fascinating and wide-ranging subject that varies from a scientific to
more personal approach with a range of approaches to studying and understanding behavior.
As a behavioral science, it examines the way, behavior is learned and can be changed. As a
social science, it focuses on behavior of people within the context of families, group,
communities, and societies. As a biological science, it explores how the brain and
physiological systems relate to human behavior. As cognitive science, it explores perception,
memory, attention, language, thinking and other cognitive factors in developing critical
thinking skills, and learn to integrate present information from diverse perspectives. The
overarching goal of psychology is to understand the behavior, mental functions, and
emotional processes of human beings. However, this field ultimately aims to benefit society,
partly through its focus on better understanding of human behaviors and humans in general.
The programs offered at the Department of Psychology have been carefully designed
to cater the latest curriculum needs and job requirements in the dynamic field of psychology
in today’s world. The faculty and students at Department of Psychology actively participate
